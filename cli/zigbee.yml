# NOTE: Only changes should be defined here.

  # This field is optional, and in most cases this might not be needed.
  # But it is possible that board can be flashed
  # with some non-default bootloader, or that the generated firmware is not
  # placed correctly in memory. This setting can help in above situations.
  # Also this option can be used to try and support boards that
  # are not labeled as officialy supported.
  #bootloader: nrf52_legacy

  # This option will add UART loging functionality.
  # User can choose which console to use(usb or uart).
  # UART has to be defined either in default device tree,
  # or in `board.uart` section.
  # Quite limited for now, but can be easily extended
